<section>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This project aims to develop a computer vision model that can accurately detect whether a person in a photograph is sitting or standing. By leveraging the power of machine learning and image processing techniques in Python, this model analyzes the features of a personâ€™s posture and classifies them as either sitting or standing.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Utility of the Project</h2>
    <p>The ability to detect whether a person is sitting or standing has several practical applications:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Workplace Safety:</strong> In environments where proper posture is critical, such as in industrial settings, this model can help monitor workers to ensure they are in the correct position for safety reasons.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> This technology can be used in healthcare settings to monitor patients' postures, aiding in the prevention of conditions caused by poor posture.</li>
        <li><strong>Smart Surveillance:</strong> In security systems, understanding whether a person is sitting or standing can enhance the ability to detect suspicious activities or monitor occupancy.</li>
        <li><strong>Fitness and Rehabilitation:</strong> In fitness tracking and rehabilitation, this model can be used to monitor and correct posture during exercises or therapy sessions.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>The model is trained using a dataset of images labeled as either sitting or standing. Features such as body orientation, limb positions, and other visual cues are extracted from these images. The model then learns to classify new images based on these features. The process involves the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Data Collection: Gathering a diverse set of images labeled with the correct posture.</li>
        <li>Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the images for model training.</li>
        <li>Feature Extraction: Identifying key visual elements that distinguish sitting from standing.</li>
        <li>Model Training: Using a machine learning algorithm to learn from the labeled data.</li>
        <li>Evaluation: Testing the model's accuracy on new, unseen images.</li>
    </ol>
